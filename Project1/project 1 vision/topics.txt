to guide the awnsers in the code use this 
for the multiple possiblity awnsers 


const correctAnswers = ["blue", "sky blue"];
if (correctAnswers.includes(userAnswer.toLowerCase().trim())) {
  // correct
}
else{
    // incorrect
}


Im planning to have a box a emoji at the top right
with a check mark and a x mark surrounded by a 
small border box to react on the correct and wrong
output for each question.  

Use lab 8 for the scrolling concepts

Css from lab 8 and 5 

normal html  from 1 -3

also for the images i want to link it through 

<a href="nextpage.html">
  <img src="images/picture1.jpg" alt="Go to next page">
</a>

so all of them would lead to their own pages
